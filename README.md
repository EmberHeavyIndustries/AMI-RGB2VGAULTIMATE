# AMI-RGB2VGAULTIMATE is a **"revised-revised" RGB to VGA adapter** for the Amiga A500-A600-A2000 and A1200-A4000, with unique improvements:

- Fully buffered Composite HSync and VSync signals
- Selectable CSync signal for those lucky guys who own a Sony PVM monitor
- Impedance matched inputs and outputs
- Fully high quality buffered video signals
- Fully filtered spurious input frequencies: no more vertical bars on LCD screens !
- Four user selectable filter settings: precisely match your display resolution for perfect quality !
- Smaller than the original 390682-01/03 VGA dongle by commodore

# NOTE for users:

User can freely select any of the four lowpass filter profiles, to either match SD, ED, HD or FHD resolutions for maximum clarity and cleaness

Further option is to switch between HSync and CSync for Sony PVM lucky users needs
